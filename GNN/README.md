# GNN review:

## graph theory:
* Graph is a data structure that consists of vertics and edges that link vertics with each other(it means two vertics relate with each other):
* G(V,E)   V is a set of nodes. E is a set of edges between them.
* A is an adjacency matrix is a square matrix used to represent a  graph. if graph has N nodes, A would be a matrix with N x N dimensions.
* graphs use for finding for finding relationship 
*  gain prior knowledge of the graph at certain confidence before we can apply the algorithm.
*  GNN are popular  because they can automatically extract relevant features from a graph

### the size and shape might change :
* NN expect fixed size neural networks thus, we need a method that can handle arbitary graphs
