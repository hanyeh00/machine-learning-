## graph theory:
Graph is a data structure that consists of vertics and edges that link vertics with each other(it means two vertics relate with each other):
G(V,E)   V is a set of nodes. E is a set of edges between them.
A is an adjacency matrix is a square matrix used to represent a  graph. if graph has N nodes, A would be a matrix with N x N dimensions.
graphs use for finding for finding relationship
